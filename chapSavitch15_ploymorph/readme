Note that the Virtual Base Class, Virtual Function are two different 
things: 

1. Virtual base classes are created before non-virtual base classes, 
which ensures all bases get created before their derived classes.

2. If a class inherits one or more classes that have virtual parents, 
the most derived class is responsible for constructing the virtual 
base class.
