I then went to Wm. and Mary college, to wit in the spring of
1760, where I continued 2 years. It was my great good fortune,
and what probably fixed the destinies of my life that Dr. Wm.
Small of Scotland was then professor of Mathematics, a man
profound in most of the useful branches of science, with a happy
talent of communication, correct and gentlemanly manners, & an
enlarged & liberal mind. He, mostly happy for me, become soon
attached to me & made me his daily companion when not engaged in
the school; and from his conversation I got my first views of the
expansion of science & of the system of things in which we are
placed.
