Note 1 :
The following topics should be crystal clear: 
1. Append, Delete, Insert, Reverse, Rotate, Shuffle 
2. Sort (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Indirect Insertion) 
2. Linear Search Algorithm, Binary Search Algorithm

The array has an associated base address. To find the element with 
index[r][c], calculate:

base + r * (5*itemSize) + c*itemSize

where,
base is the array’s base memory address
r is the row of the element to find
itemSize is the size (in terms of memory) of each element in the array
c is the column of the element to find 


The above calculation computes the proper memory offset for the element 
with subscript [r][c]. This is why a programmer must explicitly declare 
the number of columns when using arrays with two or more dimensions. We 
only need to know the row and column location of the element we wish to 
reference. The program loader’s job is to calculate its memory location 
using the above formula (or one similar to it).
