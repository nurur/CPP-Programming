The this pointer is a pointer accessible only within the non-static 
methods of a class. It points to the object for which the method is 
called. 

Static methods do not have a this pointer (since they can be called 
without an object).


>
When a non-static method is called for an object, the address of the 
object is passed by the compiler as an additional, hidden argument 
to the method. For example, the following method call:

Date myDate(6, 12, 2010);

myDate.set_month(8);


can be interpreted this way:

set_month(&myDate, 8);

The object's address is available from within the method as the this 
pointer.
